<h2>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h2>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 11 January 2026</p>
<p>
      Aderrig Neighbourhood Watch (ANW) is a community-based, voluntary initiative
      created, managed and maintained by residents and volunteers of the Aderrig area.
      This website exists solely to support community communication, awareness and
      cooperation among residents.
    </p>
<p>
      All information published on this website is voluntarily provided by residents.
      ANW acts strictly as a community platform for recording and sharing information
      and does not verify, validate, investigate or independently confirm the accuracy,
      completeness or reliability of any content submitted by users.
    </p>
<p>
      ANW is not a security service, law enforcement body, emergency response service
      or monitoring organisation. This platform does not replace or represent An Garda
      Síochána, emergency services or any public authority, and it has no role in
      requesting, directing or enforcing action by such bodies.
    </p>
<p>
      By using this website, users acknowledge that any actions or decisions taken
      based on information obtained through the platform are made at their own
      discretion and risk. ANW, its administrators and volunteers accept no liability
      for any loss, damage or claim arising directly or indirectly from the use of
      information shared on this site.
    </p>
<h3>Personal Data</h3>
<p>
      Personal data provided by residents — including names, email addresses,
      eircodes, approximate addresses, phone numbers and other information voluntarily
      submitted — is used solely for legitimate community, organisational and
      communication purposes within the scope of ANW.
    </p>
<p>
      ANW does not sell, rent or share personal data with third parties for commercial
      purposes. Data is accessed only by authorised administrators and is processed
      in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679 – GDPR)
      and applicable Irish data protection law.
    </p>
<h3>Community Sponsors</h3>
<p>
      Aderrig Neighbourhood Watch may receive voluntary financial support from
      local businesses and organisations referred to as <strong>Community Sponsors</strong>.
      This support exists solely to help cover the costs associated with website
      hosting, technical maintenance and the continued operation of this community
      platform.
    </p>
<p>
      Community Sponsors have <strong>no access</strong> to resident information,
      personal data, reports, alerts, administrative systems or any operational
      functions of the platform. Sponsorship does not imply endorsement,
      recommendation or preferential treatment of any business or service.
    </p>
<p>
      Sponsor logos may be displayed on the website in a small, uniform and
      non-commercial format to acknowledge their support for the community.
    </p>
<h4>Logo specification for Community Supporters</h4>
<ul class="tiny">
<li><strong>Format:</strong> PNG or WEBP</li>
<li><strong>Recommended size:</strong> 400 × 200 pixels</li>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> Transparent or white</li>
<li><strong>Orientation:</strong> Horizontal logos preferred</li>
<li><strong>File size:</strong> Under 200 KB</li>
</ul>
<p>
      Logos are displayed in a small, uniform format to ensure a non-commercial,
      community-focused appearance.
    </p>
<h3>Security and Audit Logging</h3>
<p>
      For security, operational integrity and audit purposes, ANW records limited
      technical information relating to successful account logins. This may include
      the date and time of login, the associated residence (eircode), and a basic
      account identifier.
    </p>
<p>
      These records are used exclusively to:
    </p>
<ul class="tiny">
<li>Protect the platform against unauthorised access or misuse</li>
<li>Investigate security incidents or account abuse</li>
<li>Maintain the integrity of the community platform</li>
</ul>
<p>
      Audit records are retained for a maximum period of <strong>six (6) months</strong>
      and are then automatically deleted. Access to these records is strictly limited
      to authorised administrators.
    </p>
<h3>Community Alerts and Communications</h3>
<p>
      Residents may opt in to receive community alerts and notifications. These
      communications may be delivered by email and, where implemented, by SMS,
      WhatsApp or similar channels.
    </p>
<p>
      Participation in alert systems is entirely optional and based on explicit
      consent. Residents may withdraw consent at any time through their account
      settings or by contacting an administrator.
    </p>
<h3>User Rights</h3>
<p>
      Residents have the right to request access to their personal data, request
      correction or deletion of inaccurate data, and withdraw consent where
      applicable, subject to legal and operational limitations.
    </p>
<p>
      Requests relating to personal data or privacy may be directed to an
      administrator via the contact details provided on this site.
    </p>
<p>
      By creating an account or continuing to use this website, users confirm that
      they have read, understood and accepted this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
      Users who do not agree should refrain from using the platform.
    </p>
<p>
      ANW reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use from time
      to time to reflect legal requirements, operational changes or community needs.
