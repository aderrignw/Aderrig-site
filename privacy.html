    </p>

    <p class="justify">
      Because data is stored in Netlify, clearing browser data will not remove stored site information. Access to your data depends on site access and any admin rules set within the site.

    </p>

    <h3>Incident reports</h3>
    <p class="justify">
      Incident reports are created and stored by residents for their own reference.
      Residents may choose to prepare and send reports by email to relevant authorities
      using their own email client.
    </p>

    <h3>Data protection</h3>
    <p class="justify">
      This site follows the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
      in terms of transparency, purpose limitation and data minimisation. As a community
      pilot project, this platform does not currently operate a central database.
